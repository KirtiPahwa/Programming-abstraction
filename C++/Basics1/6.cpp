/* Inline functions:

When the program executes the function call instruction the CPU stores the memory address of the instruction following the function call, copies the arguments of the function on the stack and finally transfers control to the specified function. The CPU then executes the function code, stores the function return value in a predefined memory location/register and returns control to the calling function. This can become overhead if the execution time of function is less than the switching time from the caller function to called function (callee). For functions that are large and/or perform complex tasks, the overhead of the function call is usually insignificant compared to the amount of time the function takes to run. However, for small, commonly-used functions, the time needed to make the function call is often a lot more than the time needed to actually execute the functionâ€™s code. This overhead occurs for small functions because execution time of small function is less than the switching time.

C++ provides an inline functions to reduce the function call overhead. Inline function is a function that is expanded in line when it is called. When the inline function is called whole code of the inline function gets inserted or substituted at the point of inline function call. This substitution is performed by the C++ compiler at compile time. Inline function may increase efficiency if it is small.
The syntax for defining the function inline is:

inline return-type function-name(parameters)
{
    // function code
}



Compiler ignore the inline request:
1.If a functions contains a loop.
2. If a function is recusive.
3.If a function contain static variables.
4. If a function return type is other than void, and the return statement doesnot exist in function body.
5. If a function contains switch or go to statement.


Advantages:
1. Function call overhead doesnot occur
        -- the overhead of push/pop variables on the stack when function is called.
        -- overhead of a return call from a function.
        (overhead is cost, time or memory usage)
2. this function is useful for embedded systems bcz inline can yield less code than the function call preamble and return.
